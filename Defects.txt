Changes for WAOT for 1.1:

1] Mouse croshhair does not change when hovered over buttons b4,b5,b6,b7,b8,b9 in Main.java
 
2] When any icon is exited from SystemTray, entire application quits. The solution is making requisite changes to the UserAuth.java file so the SytemTray is removed and the process is terminated. 

3] Time-based Shudown does not terminate all applications when it shutsdown.

4] The Mnemonic for Time-based shutdown and "System Info" is same in Main.java file
